Python Compressed Sensing algorithms
-------------------------------------

Python implementation of various Compressed Sensing algorithms, some of them originally implemented in Matlab.
Algorithms implemented:
- l1 minimization from l1magic
- Orthogonal Matching Pursuit
- Smoothed L0
- Greedy Analysis Pursuit
- NESTA
- Two Stage Thresholding
- Analysis-By-Synthesis (my paper)

Not thoroughly tested, but I use them for my research. Use at own risk.
